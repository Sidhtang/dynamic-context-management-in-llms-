1.Sliding Window Techniques
Instead of using a fixed context window, adaptively slide the window based on relevance
Maintain most recent context plus semantically important earlier chunks
Prune redundant or less relevant information
2. Hierarchical Chunking
Break long contexts into nested levels of abstractions
Top level: High-level summary/key points
Lower levels: Increasing detail
Navigate between levels based on query needs
3.Relevance Scoring
Calculate relevance scores between current query and context chunks
Use embeddings similarity or learned relevance models
Keep highest scoring chunks in active context
Cache others for potential retrieval
4.Memory Compression
Compress repetitive/redundant information
Store compressed representations of past context
Decompress only when needed for specific queries
Use techniques like semantic compression or key-value memories
5.Task-Aware Context Selection
Adapt context management strategy based on task type
Writing tasks: Keep stylistic elements and broader context
QA tasks: Focus on factual, relevant chunks
Coding tasks: Maintain function definitions and dependencies
